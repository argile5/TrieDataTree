# Trie Data Tree in Python
A very simple data tree using python 

For education and learning. I made it as simple as possible so everyone can understand it, 
as I learned it by doing it myself. 
A data tree in Python is just a nested dictionary and thats what I demonstrate here. 
The program comments explain what is going on.

questions?  email Argile5@yahoo.com  Ill be happy to explain what I did.
